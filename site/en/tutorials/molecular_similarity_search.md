# Molecular Similarity Search 

Drug discovery is an important part of new medicine research and development. The process of drug discovery includes target selection and confirmation. When fragments or lead compounds are discovered, researchers usually search for similar compounds in internal or commercial libraries in order to discover structure-activity relationship (SAR), compound availability. Ultimately, they will evaluate the potential of the lead compounds to be optimized to candidate compounds.

In order to discover available compounds from billion-scale compound libraries, chemical fingerprint is usually retrieved for substructure search and molecule similarity search.

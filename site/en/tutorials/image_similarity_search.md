# Image Similarity Search 

Major search engines like Google already give users the option to search by image. Additionally, e-commerce platforms have realized the benefits this functionality offers online shoppers, with Amazon incorporating image search into its smartphone applications.

<br/>

Milvus, the open-source vector database, makes it possible for any business to create their own reverse image search system, lowering the barriers to entry for this increasingly in-demand feature. You can use pre-trained AI models to convert your own image datasets into vectors, and then leverage Milvus to enable searching for similar products by image.

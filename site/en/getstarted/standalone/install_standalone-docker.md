## Install Milvus Standalone


1. Pull the Docker image:

```
$ sudo docker pull milvusdb/milvus:2.0.0-d043021-19c36b
```

2. Download **docker-compose.standalone.yml** and save it as **docker-compose.yml**:

```
$ mkdir -p /home/$USER/milvus
$ cd home/$USER/milvus
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/milvus-io/milvus/v2.0.0/deployments/docker/docker-compose.standalone.yml -O docker-compose.yml
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/milvus-io/milvus/v2.0.0/deployments/docker/.env
```
> The **.env** file contains all variable definitions used in **docker-compose.yml**. Ensure that you set the docker image in `TARGET_DOCKER_IMAGE` to the image defined in the **.env** file.
```
TARGET_DOCKER_IMAGE=milvusdb/milvus:2.0.0-d
```

# Install Milvus Cluster with Helm

This topic introduces how to deploy a Milvus cluster with Helm on Kubernetes (K8s).

## Prerequisites

Check [the requirements](prerequisite-helm.md) for hardware and software prior to your installation.

## Create a K8s Cluster

If you have already deployed a K8s cluster for production, you can skip this step and proceed directly to [Install Helm Chart for Milvus](install_cluster-helm.md#Install-Helm-Chart-for-Milvus). If not, you can follow the steps below to quickly create a K8s for testing, and then use it to deploy a Milvus cluster with Helm. 

{{fragments/create_a_k8s_cluster_using_minikube.md}}

minikube has a dependency on default StorageClass when installed. Check the dependency by running the following command. Other installation methods require manual configuration of the StorageClass. See [Change the default StorageClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/change-default-storage-class/) for more information.

```
$ kubectl get sc
```

```
NAME                  PROVISIONER                  RECLAIMPOLICY    VOLUMEBIINDINGMODE    ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION     AGE
standard (default)    k8s.io/minikube-hostpath     Delete           Immediate             false                    3m36s
```

## Install Helm Chart for Milvus

Helm is a K8s package manager that can help you deploy Milvus quickly.

1. Add Milvus Helm repository.

```
$ helm repo add milvus https://milvus-io.github.io/milvus-helm/
```

2. Update charts locally.

```
$ helm repo update
```

## Start Milvus

Start Milvus with Helm by specifying the release name, the chart, and parameters you expect to change. This topic uses <code>my-release</code> as the release name. To use a different release name, replace <code>my-release</code> in the command.

```
$ helm install my-release milvus/milvus
```

<div class="alert note">
  <ul>
    <li>The release name should only contain letters, numbers and dashes. Dots are not allowed in the release name.</li>
    <li>The default command line installs cluster version of Milvus while installing Milvus with Helm. Further setting is needed while installing Milvus standalone.</li>
    <li>See <a href="https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/milvus/milvus">Milvus Helm Chart</a> and <a href="https://helm.sh/docs/">Helm</a> for more information.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

Check the status of the running pods.

```
$ kubectl get pods
```

After Milvus starts, the `READY` column displays `1/1` for all pods.

```

## Connect to Milvus

Verify which local port the Milvus server is listening on. Replace the pod name with your own.

```bash
$ kubectl get pod my-release-milvus-standalone-54c4f88cb9-f84pf --template
='{{(index (index .spec.containers 0).ports 0).containerPort}}{{"\n"}}'
19530
```

Open a new terminal and run the following command to forward a local port to the port that Milvus uses. Optionally, omit the designated port and use `:19530` to let `kubectl` allocate a local port for you so that you don't have to manage port conflicts.

```bash
$ kubectl port-forward service/my-release-milvus 27017:19530
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:27017 -> 19530
```

## Uninstall Milvus

Run the following command to uninstall Milvus.

```bash
$ helm uninstall my-release
```

## Stop the K8s cluster

Stop the cluster and the minikube VM without deleting the resources you created.

```bash
$ minikube stop
```

Run `minikube start` to restart the cluster.


## Delete the K8s cluster

<div class="alert note">
Run <code>$ kubectl logs `pod_name`</code> to get the <code>stderr</code> log of the pod before deleting the cluster and all resources.
</div>

Delete the cluster, the minikube VM, and all resources you created including persistent volumes.

```bash
$ minikube delete
```

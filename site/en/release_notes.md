## v2.2.0
Release date: 18 November, 2022

| Milvus version | Python SDK version | Java SDK version | Go SDK version | Node.js SDK version |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| 2.2.0          | 2.2.0              | 2.2.1            | 2.2.0          | 2.2.0               |

Milvus 2.2.0 introduces many new features including support for Disk-based approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithm, bulk insertion of entities from files, and role-based access control (RBAC) for an improved security. In addition, this major release also ushers in a new era for vector search with enhanced stability, faster search speed, and more flexible scalability.

<h3 id="v2.2.0">Breaking changes</h3> 

Since metadata storage is refined and API usage is normalized, Milvus 2.2 is *not* fully compatible with earlier releases. Read [this guide](upgrade_milvus_cluster-helm.md) to learn how to safely upgrade from Milvus 2.1.x to 2.2.0.

<h3 id="v2.2.0">Features</h3> 

- Support for bulk insertion of entities from files
Milvus now offers a new set of bulk insertion APIs to make data insertion more efficient. You can now upload entities in a Json file directly to Milvus. See [Insert Entities from Files](bulk_insert.md) for details.

- Query result pagination 
To avoid massive search and query results returned in a single RPC, Milvus now supports configuring offset and filtering results with keywords in searches and queries. See [Search](search.md) and [Query](query.md) for details.


- Role-based access control (RBAC)
Like other traditional databases, Milvus now supports RBAC so that you can manages users, roles and privileges. See [Enable RBAC](rbac.md) for details.

- Quotas and limits
Quota is a new mechanism that protects the system from OOM and crash under a burst of traffic. By imposing quota limitations, you can limit ingestion rate, search rate, etc. See [Quota and Limitation Configurations](configure_quota_limits.md) for details.


- Time to live (TTL) at a collection level
In prior releases, we only support configuring TTL at a cluster level. Milvus 2.2.0 now supports configuring collection TTL when you create or modify a collection. After setting TTL for a collection, the entities in this collection automatically expires after the specified period of time. See [Create a collection](create_collection.md) or [Modify a collection](modify_collection.md) for details.


- Support for disk-based approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) indexes (Beta)
Traditionally, you need to load the entire index into memory before search. Now with DiskANN, an SSD-resident and Vamana graph-based ANNS algorithm, you can directly search on large-scale datasets and save up to 10 times the memory.


- Data backup (Beta)
Thanks to the contribution from [Zilliz](https://zilliz.com/), Milvus 2.2.0 now provides [a tool](https://github.com/zilliztech/milvus-backup) to back up and restore data. The tool can be used either in a command line or an API server for data security.
 

<h3 id="v2.2.0">Bug fixes and stability</h3>

- Implements query coord V2, which handles all channel/segment allocation in a fully event-driven and asynchronous mode. Query coord V2 address all issues of stuck searches and accelerates failure recovery.
- Root coord and index coord are refactored for more elegant handling of errors and better task scheduling.
- Fixes the issue of invalid RocksMQ retention mechanism when Milvus Standalone restarts.
- Meta storage format in etcd is refactored. With the new compression mechanism, etcd kv size is reduced by 10 times and the issues of etcd memory and space are solved.
- Fixes a couple of memory issues when entities are continuously inserted or deleted.

<h3 id="v2.2.0">Improvements</h3>

- Performance
  - Fixes performance bottleneck to that Milvus can fully utilize all cores when CPU is more than 8 cores.
  - Dramatically improves the search throughput and reduce the latency.
  - Decreases load speed by processing load in parallel.
  
- Observability
  - Changes all log levels to `info` by default.
  - Added collection-level latency metrics for search, query, insertion, and deletion.

- Debug tool
  - [BirdWatcher](https://github.com/milvus-io/birdwatcher), the debug tool for Milvus, is further optimized as it can now connect to Milvus meta storage and inspect the part of the internal status of the Milvus system.

<h3 id="v2.2.0">Others</h3>

- Index and load
  - A collection can only be loaded with an index created on it.
  - Indexes cannot be created after a collection is loaded.
  - A loaded collection must be released before dropping the index created on this collection.
  
- Flush
  - Flush API, which forces a seal on a growing segment and syncs the segment to object storage, is now exposed to users. Calling `flush()` frequently may affect search performance as too many small segments are created. 
  - No auto-flush is triggered by any SDK APIs such as `num_entities()`, `create_index()`, etc.
  
- Time Travel
  - In Milvus 2.2,  Time Travel is disabled by default to save disk usage. To enable Time Travel, configure the parameter `common.retentionDuration` manually.

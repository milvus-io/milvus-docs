# Configure and start Prometheus
Milvus generates detailed time series metrics. This page shows you how to pull these metrics into [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), and how to connect [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) and [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/) to Prometheus for flexible data visualizations and notifications.

### Before you begin

- Make sure you have already read [Monitoring and Alerting](monitor.md) and learnt about the monitoring and alerting solutions of Milvus.

### Install Prometheus

1. Download the [Prometheus tarball](https://prometheus.io/download/) for your operating system.

2. Go to the Prometheus file directory, and make sure Prometheus is installed successfully:

   ```shell
   $ ./prometheus --version
   ```

   <div class="alert note">
   You can add the path to Prometheus to <code>PATH</code>. This makes it easy to start Prometheus from any shell.
   </div>

### Configure and start Prometheus

1. Start Pushgateway:

    ```shell
    ./pushgateway
    ```

    <div class="alert warning">
    You <i>must</i> start Pushgateway before starting the Milvus Server.
    </div>
    
2. Start the Prometheus monitor in **server_config.yaml** and set the address and port number of Pushgateway:

    ```yaml
    metric:
      enable: true       # Set the value to true to enable the Prometheus monitor.
      address: 127.0.0.1 # Set the IP address of Pushgateway.
      port: 9091         # Set the port number of Pushgateway.
    ```

    <div class="alert note">
    In the Kubernetes cluster, you need to set the <b>server_config.yaml</b> for each node to monitor.
    </div>

3. Go to the Prometheus root directory, and download starter [Prometheus configuration file](https://github.com/milvus-io/docs/blob/v{{var.release_version}}/assets/monitoring/prometheus.yml) for Milvus:

   ```shell
   $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/milvus-io/docs/v{{var.release_version}}/assets/monitoring/prometheus.yml \ -O prometheus.yml
   ```

4. Download starter [alerting rules](https://github.com/milvus-io/docs/blob/v{{var.release_version}}/assets/monitoring/alert_rules.yml) for Milvus to the Prometheus root directory:

   ```shell
   wget -P rules https://raw.githubusercontent.com/milvus-io/docs/v{{var.release_version}}/assets/monitoring/alert_rules.yml
   ```

5. Edit the Prometheus configuration file according to your needs:

   - global: Configures parameters such as `scrape_interval` and `evaluation_interval`.

   ```yaml
   global:
     scrape_interval:     2s # Set the crawl time interval to 2s.
     evaluation_interval: 2s # Set the evaluation interval to 2s.
   ```

   - alerting: Sets the address and port of Alertmanager.

   ```yaml
   alerting:
   alertmanagers:
   - static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9093']
   ```

   - rule_files: Specifies the file that defines the alerting rules.

   ```yaml
   rule_files:
      - "alert_rules.yml"
   ```

   - scrape_configs: Sets `job_name` and `targets` for scraping data.

   ```yaml
   scrape_configs:
   - job_name: 'prometheus'
      static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']

   - job_name: 'pushgateway'
      honor_labels: true
      static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9091']
   ```

   <div class="alert note">
    See <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/">Prometheus Configuration</a> for more information about the configuration file of Prometheus.
   </div>
   
6. Start Prometheus:

    ```shell
    ./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
    ```

## Configure Alertmanager


### Events to create alert rules

Active monitoring helps you identify problems early, but it is also essential to create alerting rules that promptly send notifications when there are events that require investigation or intervention.

This section includes the most important events for which you must create alerting rules.

**Server is down**

- Rule: Send an alert when the Milvus server is down.
- How to detect: If the Milvus server is down, **No Data** will be displayed on the monitoring dashboard.

**CPU/GPU temperature is too high**

- Rule: Send an alert when the CPU/GPU temperature exceeds 80 degrees Celsius.
- How to detect: Check the metrics `CPU Temperature` and  `GPU Temperature` on the monitoring dashboard.


### Configuration steps

1. Download the [latest Alertmanager tarball](https://prometheus.io/download/#alertmanager) for your operating system.

2. Ensure that Alertmanager is properly installed:

   ```shell
   $ alertmanager --version
   ```

   <div class="alert note">
   You can add the path to Alertmanager to <code>PATH</code>. This makes it easy to start Alertmanager from any shell.
   </div>

3. Create the [Alertmanager configuration file](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/configuration/) to specify the desired receivers for notifications, and add it to Alertmanager root directory.

4. Start the Alertmanager server, with the `--config.file` flag pointing to the configuration file:

   ```shell
   alertmanager --config.file=alertmanager.yml
   ```

5. Use your browser to open *http://<*hostname of machine running alertmanager*>:9093*, and use the Alertmanager UI to define rules for [muting alerts](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/#silences).

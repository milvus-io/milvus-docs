# Users and Roles

This topic explains the definition of users, roles, objects, and privileges in role-based access control (RBAC).

- **Object:** An object to grant or deny access to. The object can be a collection, a partition, etc. 

- **User:** A user identity with a username and a corresponding password.

- **Privilege:** A privilege defines the actions that can be performed and resources that can be accessed. A privilege cannot be granted to a user directly. It has to be granted to a role first.

- **Role:** A role defines the privilege(s) a user has to certain objects. After binding a role to a user, the user inherits all the privileges that are granted to this role.

The following figure illustrates the relationship between objects, privileges, roles, and users.

The relationship between object, privilege, role and user.

Milvus creates a `root` user by default. The `root` user is granted the `admin` privileges, which means that this `root` user can have access to all resources and perform all actions.

If a user is bind with a `public` role, this user is entitled to the privileges of `DescribeCollection`, `ShowCollections`, and `IndexDetail`.

The following table lists the values you can choose when [enabling RBAC](rbac.md).

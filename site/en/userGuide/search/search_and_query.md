# Search and Query

Conduct a search, query, or hybrid search to find relevant results.

- [Search](search.md): A vector similarity search in Milvus calculates the distance between query vector(s) and vectors in a collection and returns the most similar results.
- [Hybrid Search](hybridsearch.md): A hybrid search in Milvus is essentially a vector search with attribute filtering.
- [Query](query.md): A vector query in Milvus retrieves vectors via scalar filtering based on boolean expression.

# Overview


This section covers fundamentals and basic Milvus operations in Python interactive mode.

Type `python3` in your terminal to enter Python interactive mode. Here we take Python 3.9.1 as an example:

```
âžœ  ~ python3
Python 3.9.1 (default, Feb  3 2021, 07:38:02)
[Clang 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.29)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

## Connect to the Milvus server

```
>>> from pymilvus_orm import connections
>>> connections.connect("default", host='localhost', port='19530')
```

## Close server connection
When you no longer need Milvus services, you can call `close()` to release all connection resources to the Milvus server:

```
>>> connections.disconnect("default")
```

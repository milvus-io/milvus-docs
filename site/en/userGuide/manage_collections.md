# Manage Collections

A Milvus collection is similar to a table in traditional databases and is used to store and manage data. Learn about the collection-level operations.

- [Create a Collection](create_collection.md): Create a collection with the book collection example.

- [Check Collection Information](check_collection.md): Check the basic information of a collection in Milvus including its name, number of entities, and more.

- [Drop a Collection](drop_collection.md): Caution is needed as the delete operation irreversibly drops the collection and all data within it.

- [Manage Collection Alias](collection_alias.md): Milvus supports specifying a unique alias for a collection.

- [Load a Collection](load_collection.md): Load the collection to memory before a search or a query. Milvus 2.1 now supports loading a collection as multiple replicas.

- [Release a Collection](release_collection.md): Release a collection from memory after a search or a query to reduce memory usage.

summary: "Send an idempotency key so that a retried bulk import resolves to the original job instead of creating a second one."

# Idempotent Bulk Import

A bulk import request can succeed while its response is lost: the call times out, the connection drops, or your orchestrator dies before it saves the returned `jobId`. You cannot tell "not done" from "done, reply lost". Retrying starts a second job and every row lands twice; not retrying may lose the import.

An idempotency key removes the choice. Tag the request with one, and a retry carrying the same key returns the original `jobId` instead of creating a second job.

Idempotent bulk import requires Milvus 3.0.2 or later, or 2.6.24 or later on the 2.6 line. An older server ignores the header and every request, retry or not, starts a new job.

## Sending the key

The key travels as the `Idempotency-Key` HTTP header, not in the request body.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:19530/v2/vectordb/jobs/import/create" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer root:Milvus" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: nightly-2026-09-07-batch-3" \
  -d '{"collectionName": "events", "files": [["events/2026-09-07/part-0.parquet"]]}'
```

<!-- TODO: milvus-io/pymilvus#3784 (master) and its backports milvus-io/pymilvus#3807 (3.0) and milvus-io/pymilvus#3808 (2.6) are not released yet. After they are released, verify this example against the released API and name the minimum pymilvus version for each release line in the paragraph below. -->
```python
from pymilvus.bulk_writer import IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_HEADER, bulk_import

resp = bulk_import(
    url="http://localhost:19530",
    collection_name="events",
    files=[["events/2026-09-07/part-0.parquet"]],
    headers={IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_HEADER: "nightly-2026-09-07-batch-3"},
)
resp.json()["data"]["jobId"]   # the same id on every retry
```

`IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_HEADER` is `"Idempotency-Key"`; the raw string works too. A pymilvus older than the one that added the `headers` parameter does not fall back to a plain import. The `import` line above raises `ImportError`. With the raw string, `bulk_import` raises `MilvusException`. In both cases nothing is submitted.

Poll `/v2/vectordb/jobs/import/describe` with the returned `jobId` as usual. A retry that arrives while the original is still being registered waits for it, so a retry never observes a half-registered job.

## Choosing a key

- **One key per logical request.** Name the unit of work, such as `orders-2026-09-07-batch-3`, or generate a UUID and store it with the work item before you send the request. Include an attempt number if you may need to re-run the same work.
- **Retry with the same key.** Minting a new key on a retry is what duplicates data. The exceptions are listed under [When to send a new key](#when-to-send-a-new-key).
- **Never reuse a key for different files.** Milvus does not compare the two requests. You get the original `jobId` back, and the new files are not imported.
- **Keep it short and printable.** Printable ASCII, at most 256 bytes by default (`streaming.idempotency.maxKeyLength`). Anything else is rejected with error `1100`.
- **Do not put secrets in it.** The key is stored with your data.

## How long a key is remembered

The key is scoped to the collection by its internal ID, so renaming the collection does not break a retry, as long as the retry names the collection by its new name. Dropping and recreating the collection under the same name does break it, and a fresh job is the right answer there.

Milvus remembers an import key for about a day. Treat that as nominal rather than guaranteed: heavy DDL or import traffic shortens it, and a coordinator restart lengthens it. A retry after the key is forgotten starts a fresh job.

## When to send a new key

Two cases, and only two:

- **The original job failed or was aborted.** Describe returns `state: Failed` with a reason. Retrying the key returns that same `jobId` for as long as the key is remembered. Fix the cause, then send a new key.
- **The original job was cleaned up.** Milvus keeps finished jobs for `dataCoord.import.taskRetention` (48 hours by default). If that expires while the key is still remembered, the retry returns the old `jobId`, and describe answers with the error `import job does not exist` instead of a job state. That job may have succeeded. Confirm the data is missing before you send a new key.

A retry that is rejected, for example because the import job limit is full, is not one of these cases. Retry it later with the same key.

## Configuration

Four parameters bound the behavior on this page. None of them needs changing for the key to work.

| Parameter | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `streaming.walBroadcaster.tombstone.maxLifetime` | `24h` | How long an import key is remembered. Not present in the default `milvus.yaml`; add it explicitly to change it. The same store also rejects duplicate DDL submissions, so do not lower it just to shorten the import window. |
| `streaming.walBroadcaster.tombstone.maxCount` | `8192` | How many keys and DDL records the same store holds before the oldest are dropped, whatever their age. This is what lets heavy DDL or import traffic forget a key before `maxLifetime`. Not present in the default `milvus.yaml`. |
| `dataCoord.import.taskRetention` | `172800` (48 hours) since 2.6.24 and 3.0.2; `10800` before | How long a finished import job stays queryable. Keep it at least twice `maxLifetime`. |
| `streaming.idempotency.maxKeyLength` | `256` | The maximum key length in bytes. A longer key is rejected with error `1100`. `0` rejects every key. Not present in the default `milvus.yaml`. |

The `milvus.yaml` shipped before 2.6.24 and 3.0.2 sets `taskRetention: 10800` explicitly, and an upgrade does not override a value in your file. If you upgraded with that file, raise `taskRetention` to at least twice `maxLifetime`. The new value applies only to jobs that finish after the change.

# Delete Entities

This topic describes how to delete entities in Milvus.

Milvus supports deleting entities by primary key filtered with boolean expression.


<div class="alert caution">
    <ul>
        <li>This feature is still under active development, and will be optimized with the release of Milvus 2.0.0-GA.</li>
	<li>Entities deleted beyond the pre-specified span of time for Time Travel cannot be retrieved again.</li>
        <li>Frequent deletion operations will impact the system performance.</li>
    </ul>
</div>


## Prepare boolean expression

Prepare the boolean expression that filters the entities to delete. See [Boolean Expression Rules](boolean.md) for more information.

The following example filters data with primary key values of `0` and `1`.

```python
expr = "book_id in [0,1]"
```

```javascript
const expr = "book_id in [0,1]";
```

```cli
delete entities -c book
The expression to specify entities to be deletedï¼š pk in [0,1]
```

<table class="language-cli">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Option</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>-c</td>
            <td>The name of the collection.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>-p (Optional)</td>
            <td>The name of the partition that the entities belong to.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>


## Delete entities

Delete the entities with the boolean expression you created. Milvus returns the ID list of the deleted entities.

By specifying `partition_name`, you can decide from which partition to delete the entities and thus save the resources.

{{fragments/multiple_code.md}}

```python
from pymilvus import Collection
collection = Collection("book")      # Get an existing collection.
collection.delete(expr)
```

```javascript
await milvusClient.dataManager.deleteEntities({
  collection_name: "book",
  expr: expr,
});
```

```cli
You are trying to delete the entities of collection. This action cannot be undone!
Do you want to continue? [y/N]: y
```

<table class="language-python">
	<thead>
	<tr>
		<th>Parameter</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>

	<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td><code>expr</code></td>
		<td>Boolean expression that specifies the entities to delete.</td>
	</tr>
  <tr>
		<td><code>partition_name</code> (optional)</td>
		<td>Name of the partition to delete entities from.</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

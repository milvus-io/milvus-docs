The System View dashboard consists of the following tiles:

- **Topology**: Shows the structure of your Milvus instance. Click Milvus node or a coordinator node and the corresponding information appears in the Info tile on the right.
- **Info**: Shows the system and configuration information of the selected node.

## Node list view

All nodes managed by their parent coordinator node are listed in the table. You can sort the nodes by metrics including **CPU Core Count**, **CPU Core Usage**, **Disk Usage**, and **Memory Usage**.

Right to the table is a mini topology showing the selected node and its coordinator node. Under the mini topology is a tile showing relevant information.

## Install Helm Chart for Milvus

Helm is a Kubernetes package manager that can help you deploy Milvus quickly.

1. Add Milvus Helm repository.

```
$ helm repo add milvus https://milvus-io.github.io/milvus-helm/
```

2. Update charts locally.

```
$ helm repo update
```

## Install Attu while installing Milvus

Start Milvus and Attu with Helm by specifying the release name, the chart, and the parameters that indicate the installation of Attu. This topic uses `my-release` as the release name. To use a different release name, replace `my-release` in the command.

Kubernetes provides four service modes: ClusterIp, Ingress, LoadBalancer, and NodePort. The default service mode of Attu is ClusterIp. You can choose the  service mode that suits your application by configuring the parameters `attu.service.type` and `attu.ingress.enable`. 


1. Install Milvus and Attu

```
helm install my-release milvus/milvus --set attu.enabled=true
```

2. Forward the Attu service to local port `3000`.

```
kubectl port-forward service/my-release-milvus-attu 3000
```

3. Visit `http://my-release-milvus-attu:3000/connect` in your browser, and click **Connect** to enter the Attu service.

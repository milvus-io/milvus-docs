# Manage Indexes

Indexing is the process of efficiently organizing data, and it plays a major role in making similarity search useful by dramatically accelerating time-consuming queries on large datasets.

- [Build an Index](build_index.md): Build an index to accelerate your vector similarity search. Milvus 2.1 now supports indexes on the scalar field.

- [Drop an Index](drop_index.md): Dropping an index irreversibly removes all corresponding index files.

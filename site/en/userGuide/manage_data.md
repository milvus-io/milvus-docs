# Manage Data

Data in Milvus are called entities. An entity consists of a group of fields and is used to represent unstructured data like images, magazine articles, short videos, and more.

- [Insert Data](insert_data.md): Prepare and insert entities into Milvus. 
- [Delete Data](delete_data.md): Milvus supports deleting entities by primary key filtered with boolean expression.
- [Compact Data](compact_data.md): Milvus supports automatic data compaction by default. You can still compact data manually and check the compaction status.

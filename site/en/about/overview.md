# What is Milvus
Milvus is an open-source vector database built to power AI applications and vector similarity search. 

Milvus [Standalone](overview_standalone.md) and Milvus [Cluster](overview_cluster.md) are both available now.

## Key Concepts

### Unstructured data

Unstructured data, including images, video, audio, and natural language, doesn’t follow a predefined model or manner of organization and accounts for 80% of the world’s data. Unstructured data can be converted into vectors using various artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models.

### Vector

A vector, or vector embedding, is a representation of coordinates within an n-dimensional space. Vectorization or embedding techniques are commonly used to represent unstructured data. Vectors are usually generated by artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) models that can extract features of unstructured data. 

### Vector similarity search (ANN)

Similarity search refers to the process of comparing a target to a database to find objects that are most similar to it. By the same token, vector similar search returns the most similar vectors in a database. Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search algorithms are used to calculate similarity ([similarity metrics](https://zilliz.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TC/pages/edit-v2/271155436#)) between vectors.

# What is Milvus?
*An introduction to Milvus*

Milvus is a cloud-native, AI-infused database geared towards (embedding) vector similarity search. Milvus is dedicated to lowering the bar for unstructured data search and providing a consistent user experience regardless of users' deployment environment. 

## Milvus is an LF AI & Data Project

Milvus was released under the open-source Apache License 2.0 in October 2019. It is currently an incubation-stage project under [LF AI & Data Foundation](https://lfaidata.foundation/). 

## Key Features

- **Flexible Deployment**

Thanks to its support for both standalone and distributed deployments, Milvus is gifted with the merits of either environment - flexibility and low latency of a standalone environment and the high availability, high throughput, and high capacity of a distributed environment.

- **Functionality-level Autoscaling**

With the main functionalities implemented equivalent among nodes, Milvus is able to autoscale at the functionality level, laying the foundation for a more efficient resource scheduling. 

- **Hybrid Search**

In addition to the core data type of vectors, Milvus also introduces basic numeric types, such as boolean, integer, floating-point number. Search for data from hybrid fields are now supported.

- **Combined Data Storage**

Milvus has reinforced its support for both streaming and batch data persistence and for the adaptation of alternative message/storage engines, in response to increasing demand for higher throughput.

- **Multiple Indexes in a Single Field**

Milvus now supports multiple indexes in a vector field, and decouples indexing from querying. Users are allowed to maintain multiple indexes simultaneously and switch flexibly when necessary.

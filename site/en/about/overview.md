# What is Milvus
Milvus is an open-source vector database built to power AI applications and vector similarity search. 

## Key Features

### Millisecond search on trillion vector datasets

Average latency measured in milliseconds on trillion vector datasets.

### Simplified unstructured data management

Rich APIs designed for data science workflows.

Consistent cross-platform UX from laptop, to local cluster, to cloud.

Embed real-time search and analytics into virtually any application.

### Reliable, always on vector database

Milvus’ built-in replication and failover/failback features ensure data and applications can maintain business continuity in the event of a disruption.

### Highly scalable and elastic

Component-level scalability makes it possible to only scale where necessary.

### Community supported, industry recognized

With over 1,000 enterprise users, 5,000+ stars on GitHub, and an active open-source community, you’re not alone when you use Milvus. As an incubation-stage project under the LF AI & Data Foundation, Milvus has institutional support.

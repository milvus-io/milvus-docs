# Key Features

## Millisecond search on trillion vector datasets

Average latency measured in milliseconds on trillion vector datasets.

## Simplified unstructured data management

Rich APIs designed for data science workflows.

Consistent user experience across laptop, local cluster, and cloud.

Embed real-time search and analytics into virtually any application.

## Reliable, always on vector database

Milvus’ built-in replication and failover/failback features ensure data and applications can maintain business continuity in the event of a disruption.

## Highly scalable and elastic

Component-level scalability makes it possible to scale up and down on demand. Milvus can autoscale at a component level according to the load type, making resource scheduling much more efficient.

## Hybrid search

In addition to vectors, Milvus supports data types such as boolean, integers, floating-point numbers, and more. A collection in Milvus can hold multiple fields for accommodating different data features or properties. By complementing scalar filtering to vector similarity search, Milvus makes modern search much more flexible than ever.

## Unified Lambda structure

Milvus combines stream and batch processing for data storage to balance timeliness and efficiency. Its unified interface makes vector similarity search a breeze. 

## Community supported, industry recognized

With over 1,000 enterprise users, 6,000+ stars on GitHub, and an active open-source community, you’re not alone when you use Milvus. As a graduate project under the LF AI & Data Foundation, Milvus has institutional support.

# What is Milvus 

## Overview

Milvus is an embeddings similarity search engine that is highly flexible, reliable, and blazing fast. It supports adding, deleting, updating, and near-real-time search of embeddings on a scale of trillion bytes. By encapsulating multiple widely adopted index libraries, such as Faiss, NMSLIB, and Annoy, it provides a comprehensive set of intuitive APIs, allowing you to choose index types based on your scenario. By supporting filtering of scalar data, Milvus takes the recall rate even higher and adds more flexibility to your search. 


Milvus runs on the client-server model.

- The Milvus server comprises two parts: Milvus Core and Meta Store.

    * Milvus Core stores and manages embeddings and scalar data.
    * Meta Store stores and manages metadata in SQLite for testing or MySQL for production. 

- On the client side, Milvus provides SDKs in Python, Java, Go, and C++, as well as RESTful APIs. 

Milvus was released under the Apache 2.0 License and officially open sourced in October 2019. It is an incubation project under [LF AI Foundation](https://lfai.foundation/). The source code of Milvus is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus).

> For now, the Milvus server runs on a standalone node. For scenarios involving large datasets or requiring high concurrency, check out Mishards, our cluster sharding middleware that is currently under development.

## Scenarios

Milvus has been used in hundreds of organizations and institutions worldwide mainly in the following scenarios:

- Image, video, and audio search.
- Text search, recommender system, interactive question answering system, and other text search fields.
- Drug discovery, genetic screening, and other biomedical fields.

See [Scenarios](https://www.milvus.io/scenarios/) for more information.

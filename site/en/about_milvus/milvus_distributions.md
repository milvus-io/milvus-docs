## CPU-only Milvus vs. GPU-enabled Milvus

In Milvus, a vector search includes two separate processes: index building and search. 

- For GPU-enabled Milvus, these two processes can run concurrently, which facilitates more efficient query, especially for incremental data. 
- For CPU-only Milvus, search computation can only be executed after index building is completed, which makes it more suitable for static data.

<p>IVF_FLAT index divides a vector space into <code>nlist</code> clusters. If you keep the default value of <code>nlist</code> as 16384, Milvus compares the distances between the target vector and the centers of all 16384 clusters to get <code>nprobe</code> nearest clusters. Then Milvus compares the distances between the target vector and the vectors in the selected clusters to get the nearest vectors. Unlike IVF_FLAT, FLAT directly compares the distances between the target vector and each and every vector.

Therefore, when the total number of vectors approximately equals <code>nlist</code>, IVF_FLAT and FLAT has little difference in the way of calculation required and search performance. But as the number of vectors grows to two times, three times, or n times of <code>nlist</code>, IVF_FLAT index begins to show increasingly greater advantages.

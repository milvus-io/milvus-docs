# Search with Time Travel

This topic describes how to use the Time Travel feature during vector search.

Milvus maintains a timeline for all data insert and delete operations. It allows users to specify a timestamp in a search to retrieve a data view at a specified point in time, without spending tremendously on maintenance for data rollback.

## Connect to the Milvus server

```python
from pymilvus import connections
connections.connect("default", host='localhost', port='19530')
```

## Prepare parameters and create a collection

```python
from pymilvus import Collection, FieldSchema, CollectionSchema, DataType
collection_name = "test_time_travel"
schema = CollectionSchema([
    FieldSchema("pk", DataType.INT64, is_primary=True),
    FieldSchema("example_field", dtype=DataType.FLOAT_VECTOR, dim=2)
])
collection = Collection(collection_name, schema)
```

## Insert first batch of data

Insert random data to simulate the original data.

```python
import random
data = [
    [i for i in range(10)],
    [[random.random() for _ in range(2)] for _ in range(10)],
]
batch1 = collection.insert(data)
```

## Check the timestamp of the first data batch

Check the timestamp of the first data batch for search with Time Travel. Data inserted within the same batch share an identical timestamp.

```python
batch1.timestamp
```

```python
428828271234252802
```

<div class="alert note">
  Milvus adopts a combination of physical clock and logic counter as a hybrid timestamp. The 64-bit timestamp consists of a 46-bit physical part (high-order bits) and an 18-bit logic part (low-order bits). The physical part is the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970 (midnight UTC/GMT).
</div>



## Insert second batch of data

Insert the second batch of data to simulate the dirty data, among which a piece of data with primary key value `19` and vector value `[1.0,1.0]` is appended as the target data to search with in the following step.

```python
data = [
    [i for i in range(10, 20)],
    [[random.random() for _ in range(2)] for _ in range(9)],
]
data[1].append([1.0,1.0])
batch2 = collection.insert(data)
```

## Search with a specified timestamp

Load the collection and search the target data with the timestamp of the first data batch. With the timestamp specified, Milvus only retrieves the data view at the point of time the timestamp indicates.

```python
collection.load()
search_param = {
    "data": [[1.0, 1.0]],
    "anns_field": "example_field",
    "param": {"metric_type": "L2"},
    "limit": 10,
    "travel_timestamp": batch1.timestamp,
}
res = collection.search(**search_param)
res[0].ids
```

As shown below, the target data itself and other data inserted later are not returned as results.

```python
[8, 7, 4, 2, 5, 6, 9, 3, 0, 1]
```

If you do not specify the timestamp or specify it with the timestamp of the second data batch, Milvus will return the results from both batches.

```python
batch2.timestamp
428828283406123011
search_param = {
    "data": [[1.0, 1.0]],
    "anns_field": "example_field",
    "param": {"metric_type": "L2"},
    "limit": 10,
    "travel_timestamp": batch2.timestamp,
}
res = collection.search(**search_param)
res[0].ids
[19, 10, 8, 7, 4, 17, 2, 5, 13, 15]
```

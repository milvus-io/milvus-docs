# Milvus Documentation

Welcome to Milvus documentation!

This repository contains technical documentation for [Milvus](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus), the world's most advanced open-source vector database. 

Each branch corresponds to a Milvus release by name. We've set the branch of the latest Milvus release as the default branch. For documentation of a different Milvus release, switch to the corresponding branch. 

Note that not all documentation rendered on [milvus.io](https://milvus.io/docs/home) is hosted in this repository. 

## Active Milvus releases

Currently, we maintain the following versions of Milvus documentation in different branches:

| `v2.0.0` branch | 2.0.0 version (the default and latest branch) |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `v1.1.1` branch | 1.1.1 version                                 |
| `v1.1.0` branch | 1.1.0 version                                 |
| `v1.0.0` branch | 1.0.0 version (first with long-term support)  |

> **Note:**
> The latest branch is set as the default working branch. 
> Milvus releases prior to v1.0.0 are no longer supported, but you can still find their documentation in the corresponding branch.

## Documentation structure

In general, the folder structure of the milvus-docs repository aligns with the menu structure of Milvus documentation on [milvus.io](https://milvus.io/).

### Documentation directory

*Images* are housed under the **/assets** folder and can be referenced with **{{images.Assets/<image-name>.jpg}}**.

*Fragments* let you split the markdown into independent, reusable pieces and are defined in the **site/en/fragments** and **site/zh-CN/fragments** folders. Use the **{{fragments/xxx.md}}** syntax to reference a specific fragment.

*Variables* are used to store version information to be referenced in code or paths. They are defined in **Variables.json** and can be used in Markdown (**.md**) files, fragments, and templates. 

> The defined variables implement within the current folder and its subfolders. The **en** and **Zh-CN** folder each contains a Variables.json file.

### Languages

All documentation is originally written in English and translated into other language(s). Currently we only support two language versions: English and Chinese, stored in their corresponding folders in each branch.

# Milvus Documentation

Welcome to Milvus documentation!

This repository contains technical documentation for [Milvus](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus), the world's most advanced open-source vector database.

Each branch corresponds to a Milvus release by name. We've set the branch of the latest Milvus release as the default branch. For documentation of a different Milvus release, switch to the corresponding branch.

## Active Milvus releases

Currently, we maintain the following versions of Milvus documentation in different branches:

| `v2.0.0` branch | 2.0.0 version (the default and latest branch) |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `v1.1.1` branch | 1.1.1 version                                 |
| `v1.1.0` branch | 1.1.0 version                                 |
| `v1.0.0` branch | 1.0.0 version (first with long-term support)  |

> **Note:**
> The latest branch is set as the default working branch.
> Milvus releases prior to v1.0.0 are no longer supported, but you can still find their documentation in the corresponding branch.
